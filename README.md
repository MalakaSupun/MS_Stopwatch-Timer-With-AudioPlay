### 1 . Stopwatch  ............... 
Just like a stopwatch, the application will start running as soon as the 'Start' button is pressed. <br />
But if you started timer operations, you need to toggle the 'Stopwatch' button first. 

You can use the 'Reset' button to reset the timer at every stage of the operation.<br />
See the GIF for further assistance.....

### 2 . Timer ....................
Operation  is not different from an actual 'Timer', you need to toggle the 'Timer' button and set the timer values to run, and just press Start ' button to start timer. You can stop the timer by pressing the 'Stop' button. <br />
There will be a notification when the timer is finished.

You can use the 'Reset' button to reset the timer at every stage of the operation.<br />
See the GIF for further assistance.....

### 3 . MP3 Player ..............
First of all, playing a mp3 is not going to effect the the normal operation of the application. Because you can use this application to play mp3 other than to using for it's normal operations.<br />

* First you need to add a folder that has mp3 files to start the player. using this icon, ![FolderIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924503-d00a94ec-d1d5-4517-8929-607fcd3e7b03.png)
* Next press "Play Button" ![playIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924722-c50bd1e5-3a63-4d02-8346-ebd62b3770a5.png) to start the player...
* Press "Pause Button" ![pauseIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924829-97283423-45a2-4d2c-8df9-df8b3e9cb952.png)
  to pause the song.

** 
**Actually, the Middle part of the application is not completely transparent. I have used rgba(255,255,255,15) as its colour.Because if that part is completely transparent it is difficult to move the application window to where the user needs.**
