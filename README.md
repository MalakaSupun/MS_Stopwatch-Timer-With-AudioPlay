### 1 . Stopwatch  ............... 
Just like a stop watch, application will start running on and as soon as the 'Start' button pressed. <br />
But if we started timer operations, you need to toggle the 'Stopwatch' button first. 

You can use 'Reset' button to reset the timer at every state of the operation.<br />
See the Gif for further assistance.....

### 2 . Timer ....................
Operation  is not different from a actual 'Timer', we need to toggle the 'Timer' button and set the timer values to run, and just press Start ' button to start timer. We can stop the timer by pressing 'Stop' button. <br />

You can use 'Reset' button to reset the timer at every state of the operation.<br />
See the Gif for further assistance.....

### 3 . MP3 Player ..............
First of all playing a mp3 is not going to effect the the normal operation of the application. Because we can use this application to play mp3 other than to using for it's normal operations.<br />

* First of all you need to add folder that have mp3 files to start player. using this icon, ![FolderIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924503-d00a94ec-d1d5-4517-8929-607fcd3e7b03.png)
* Next just pressing "Play Button" ![playIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924722-c50bd1e5-3a63-4d02-8346-ebd62b3770a5.png) you can start player...
* Pressing "Pause Button" ![pauseIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924829-97283423-45a2-4d2c-8df9-df8b3e9cb952.png)
  we can pause the song. 
* ![icons8-backward-button-96](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71941117/190924877-7af6fbf4-b517-43b9-a470-b6362a64ab79.png) ,
